============================================================
version: 09/11/2017.

This data archive contains a combination of code, data (behavior, electrophysiology), stimulus material and electrode localization data.

Directories that are part of this file are:
code/    : see readme.txt in that directory for details.
data/    : contains the behavioral and electrophysiology data
stimuli/ : images that were used as stimulus material, named as StimulusID.jpg
electrodePos.xlsx   MNI coordinates of electrode position.

This data release is released jointly with a data descriptor in the journal Scientific Data. Please refer to this paper for details on the data formats and further data tables that
