This directory is part of of a publicly released dataset described in: Faraut et al., "Dataset of human medial temporal lobe single neuron activity during declarative memory encoding and recognition",
Scientific Data, in press, 2017. Please refer to this paper for details and the remainder of the dataset.

This document serves to describe the stimuli from the following folders: newolddelay, newolddelay2, newolddelay3. 

Each of these folders represents a 'variant' of the task (variant 1,2 and 3 respectively) and  has subfolders containing images used during the experiment. 
Subfolders are organized by visual category as listed below. 

Note that some subfolder names have prefixes such as "z", "zz", or "1", "2". The purpose of this is to ensure that these folders appears listed in a consistent order 
when ordered alphabetically. Otherwise, these prefixes have no meaning and can be ignored. Also, variant 1 has an additional category (ztrain), which is only used for
a training version of the task (to familiarize the patient with the task; no recordings are performed during this training session).

Newolddelay: stimulus set for variant 1
	-Category Folders: 
		houses: contains images of different types of houses and buildings
		landscapes: contains images of different landscape scenes from varying types of terrain
		mobility: contains images of different types of mobile vehicles such as cars, buses, trucks, and helicopters 
		phones: contains images of different types of phones
		smallAnimal: contains images of small animals
		ztrain: contains images of trains

Newolddelay2: stimulus set for variant 2
	-Category Folders:
		fruit: contains images of different kinds of fruit
		kids: contains images of children in different settings
		military: contains images of objects associated with the military such as helicopters, jets, and tanks
		space: contains images of objects associated with space travel such as rockets, satellites and astronauts 
		zzanimal: (contains "zz" to ensure animal pictures are the 5th and last category) contains images of different kinds of animals

Newolddelay3: stimulus set for variant 3
